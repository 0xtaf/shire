This is my personal website. I've started for the learning purposes and it will be a permanent one.

**MongoDB** was used for uploading and fetching the data of my blog posts from the database.

**NextJS** was used for making the website fast with static generation pre rendering method.  Actually, this is and hybrid website which includes server side rendering too, but not for the end users so you won't get affected by that (unless you send me a message by using the contact form) .

**JSON Web Token** was implemented for also gathering other people's posts in the near future, and also protecting the post creation API from the unknown users.
